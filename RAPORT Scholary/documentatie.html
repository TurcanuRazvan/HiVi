			This project is a Web browser extension that allows the user to visualize in multiple ways 
			his navigation history and the bookmarks.
			In a world based on communication, the way in which information is presented plays a role as
			important as the actual content being transmitted.

            Introduction
        </h1>
		<p>
			HiVi extension offers multiple manners to visualize the navigation history and favorite local or external 
			web addresses taken from external sources(for example: Pocket).
			
		</p>
		<p> 
			Graphical representations are generated and exported in PNG and SVG formats.
		</p>
		<p>
			The setup for this extension will be easy to configure. For exemple, the user will be able to exclude 
			some Internet domains or particular URLs in order to not be displayed.
		</p>
    </section>

		<h1>
			Technologies
		</h1>
		<p>
			The standard technology for generating graphical reprezentations and exporting them in PNG and SVG formats is using D3 library.

			SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. 
			As XML files, SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, as well as with drawing software.

			A major modern web browser, Google Chrome have SVG rendering support. 
		</p>
		<p>
			JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. 
			Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. 
			It is used to make webpages interactive
		</p>
		<p>
			jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
			jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations and handle events.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
		</p>
		<p>
			HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; 
			it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces 
			markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
			presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used 
			to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, 
			the language can be applied to any XML document, including SVG. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most 
			websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, 
			and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			D3.js (or just D3 for Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for producing 
			dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of the widely
			implemented SVG, HTML5, and CSS standards. It is the successor to the earlier Protovis
			framework. In contrast to many other libraries, D3.js allows great control over the
			final visual result.
		</p>
		<p>
			D3 allows us to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply 
			data-driven transformations to the document. For example, we could use D3 to create an 
			interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction. Or even better, an 
			extraordinary graph with a part of the client's browser searched history.

			Arhitecture
		</h1>
		
		<p>
			Beside the fact that this aplication is displayed on UI, it is not linked to a database 
			or a server and it can be used offline.
			The application can be used on mobile devices as well because is very responsive.
		</p>
		<img src = "arhitecture.png" alt="Arhitecture image">
		<p>
			This Single Page Application is an extension that request the client history browser, 
			get it in response and display it as a list, a SVG Representation with elipses that represents 
			every domain that the user accesed linked to next domains where the user was redirected.
		</p>

	<section>
		<h1>
			How does it work?
		</h1>
		<p>
			The user must click on the icon on the browser toolsbar. The icon looks like in image above.
		</p>
		<img src="icon_image.PNG" alt="icon">
		<p>
			A pop-up with a button will be displayed to acces the history. This is displayed in the image above.
		</p>
		<img src="pop-up_image.PNG" alt="pop-up">
		<p>
			After clicking on the pop-up button the HiVi will be revealed. The user will have displayed a
			describing page of the aplication.
		</p>
		<img src="first_image.png" alt="Describing page">
		<p>
			This page relate about what is the purpose of it and has three important linking buttons:
			<ol>
			<li>About</li>
			<li>History</li>
			<li>Graphics</li>
			</ol>
			The first one is sort of a "Home" button where the user is able to read the purpose of this 
			extension and it's "creators". This button redirects to the main page.
		</p>
		<p>
		After clicking the second button the user will be lead to his navigation history where he can 
		delete some of his unwanted to be displayed links. Because we all know that "a picture worth a 
		thousand words", we will let you to see how does it works.
		</p>
		<img src= "delete_history_image.png" alt="Deletion part">
		<p>
		The third button will reveal "the heart of the HiVi", the Graph Representation of the history along 
		the exporting part, where the user can see his main domains searched exported into SVG or PNG format.
		</p>
		<!--<img src="Export.png" alt="Export image">-->
		<img src = "Export image 1.PNG" alt = "Export image 1">

		<h2>
			Conclusion
		</h2>
		<p>
			In conclusion, this browser web extension has multiple manners of displaying the history of navigation.
			The most interesting thing is that the user is able to extract all the relevant information in a 
			SVG or PNG file.
		</p>
		<p>
			A better version of this extension could be to storage in cloud for the user bookmarks.
