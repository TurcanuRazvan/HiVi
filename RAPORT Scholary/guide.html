		<h2>
			Conclusion
		</h2>
		<p>
			In conclusion, this browser web extension will have multiple manners of displaying the history of navigation.
			The most interesting thing is that the user is able to extract all the relevant information in a SVG or
			PNG file.
		</p>
		<p>
			A better version of this extension could be to storage in cloud for the user bookmarks.
